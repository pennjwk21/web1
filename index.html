  <h1> Origin of the city as colonization and imperialization </h1>

  Thus far, we've tackled a host of pure spatial <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html51/"
  target="_blank" title="html5 specification">prediction problems</a>. Of these, only the previous chapter on Urban Growth Modeling (one that we, MUSA 507, does in the spring and not in the fall) had a temporal component. In that instance however, a model was trained on one time period and used to forecast development for the next time period. In this chapter, our models will explictly account for time by controlling for a host of hourly, daily and weekly fixed effects.

  Conceptually, integrating time into our models is not all that different from the spatial approach. In predicting both house prices and crime, it was hypothesized that the value here was in part, a function of values nearby. Thus far, many many different types of spatial lag features have been engineered to account for the local spatial process. For processes where time is important, a similar hypothesis can be positted - that the value at this time is in part, a function of values at previous time periods. In spatial analysis, spatial autocorrelation is the term used to describe nearby dependence. In time series analysis, the term serial autocorrelation describes dependence in time.
